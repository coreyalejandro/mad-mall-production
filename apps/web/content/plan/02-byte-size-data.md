# Byte-Size Data Collection

Goal: reduce the burden of traditional appointment-based data collection.

## Principle

Collect small, high-signal data points frequently, not everything rarely.

## Examples

- 30–60 second check-ins (symptom snapshots)
- Medication adherence pings
- Trigger events (stress, sleep disruption)
- "How are you today?" micro-surveys

## Design requirements

- Consent-first, revocable
- Low cognitive load
- Works via kiosk, SMS, web, partner tablet
