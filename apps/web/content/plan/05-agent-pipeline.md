# IBM Agent Internship Pipeline

Goal: convert "classroom agents" into safe clinical/mall roles.

## Pipeline stages

- Intake: import agent artifacts + declared capabilities
- Assessment: standardized tasks + scoring
- Placement: map to supervised roles
- Rotation: time-boxed duties (triage support, education, scheduling)
- Promotion: only with evidence + evaluation

## Key requirement

Agents cannot operate as clinicians. They operate as supervised assistants with explicit boundaries.
