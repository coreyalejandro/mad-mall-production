# Distributed Collection Network

Goal: meet people where they already are.

## Collection nodes

- Partner pharmacies
- Community events (high attendance)
- Mobile collection units
- Mail-in kits (opt-in)

## Operations model

- Event scheduling: anticipate major regional Black community events and deploy partnerships.
- "Global medical banks": secure drop-off / collection nodes.

## Data types

- Self-reported outcomes (PROs)
- Optional biosamples (requires strict governance; planned)
- Non-identifying context signals (time, region, environment)
