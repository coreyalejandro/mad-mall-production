# MADMall Vision

MADMall is a virtual luxury outdoor mall + teaching clinic designed for Black women living with Graves' disease.

## Why a mall

- Malls are social infrastructure: a safe, familiar third place (beyond home/church/work).
- The luxury outdoor mall aesthetic is intentional: calm, spacious, dignified.

## Why a teaching clinic

- The clinic is the "advanced wing" inside the mall: care, education, community support, and research operations.
- The teaching model enables an agent pipeline (IBM agents become interns → residents → attending agents) with supervision.

## What this MVP builds first

- Data collection architecture (byte-size + distributed)
- ML training component (reproducible, auditable)
- Governance and consent surfaces (fail-closed)
