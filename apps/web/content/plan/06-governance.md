# Safety + Governance

This project is about real-world consequences.

## Non-negotiables

- Consent-first collection
- Auditability (append-only logs)
- Fail-closed on missing consent, missing schema, or missing evidence
- Strict separation of:
  - Care operations vs research exports
  - Identifying vs de-identified data
